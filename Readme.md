### Lecture Material Numerik und Computersimulationen in der weichen kondensierten ###

This repo concerns the lecture
**Computersimulation und Numerik in der weichen kondensierten Materie**

There is also a [website](http://www.ipfdd.de/de/scmbp/soft-condensed-matter-and-biological-physics/numerik-und-computersimulationen-in-der-weichen-kondensierten-materie/) for this lecture.

Here you find the source code, jupyter-notebooks and worksheets. 

To use the material simple type
```
git clone https://github.com/MartinWenge/LectureWKMBP2020.git
```
or - best pratice - use the [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) and clone your own fork to be able to create pull requests. 

Then you can upload your solutions to be checked using an intuitively named branch:

```
git checkout -b yourName_branch
# Edit some code
git commit -a -m "short description of what you did"
# if main repo has moved forward and its remote was called upstream
git pull upstream master
# push changes to your fork and do the pull request on github
git push origin yourName_branch
```

If there are any questions use the [Issues-tool](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/).
